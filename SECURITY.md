# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All cogs on the `master` branch will be kept up to date with security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you discovered, message me on discord @dav_b or send me an E-Mail to [security@david-bauch.de](mailto:security@david-bauch.de).

I will reply to you as soon as possible. Expect an initial response within 7 days.

Do **NOT** publically disclose a vulnerability or open a fix PR without talking to me first.
